\item[Mayavi] is a 3D Scientific Data Visualization system supporting
  complex interactive graphics. Download it from \url{http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/}
\item[MqthGL] MathGL is a library for producing scientific
  visualizations. It is very fast and can be called from C, C++,
  Python, Qt, FLTK and OpenGL. Unfortunately, it appears to only run
  under Windows and Linux. You can download it from \url{http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/}
\item[PyQwt] provides Python bindings for the Qwt C++ graphing system,
  which creates graphics with Qt. It can create much larger
  visualizations than matplotlib, but it is somewhat more difficult to
  use. \url{http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/}
