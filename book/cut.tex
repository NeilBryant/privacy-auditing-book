Other examples of privacy leaks include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft leaking windows registration information (cite)
\item VA Laptop
\item In May 2013 a firm called Decipher Forensics revealed that Snapchat, an application that sends photos with a
  self-destruct timer, didn't actually delete photos as
  promised. Instead the program simply renamed the photos so that they
  could not be seen with normal tools on the telephone\cite{ksl-snap-chat}.
\end{itemize}
