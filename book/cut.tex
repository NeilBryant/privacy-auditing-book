One way to overcome the need to have specialized tools is to
understand how to use general tools for a specific purpose. As a
result, this book explains how to dump data buffers and
understand what the information means.


indeed, the reason the
leakage may be present is that there are no readily available tools to
view the information.

\subsection{Personally Identifiable Information?}
Most of the leaks described in the previous section share a common
theme: each involved the collection and possible release of personally
identifiable information (PII).

Other examples of privacy leaks include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft leaking windows registration information (cite)
\item VA Laptop
\item In May 2013 a firm called Decipher Forensics revealed that Snapchat, an application that sends photos with a
  self-destruct timer, didn't actually delete photos as
  promised. Instead the program simply renamed the photos so that they
  could not be seen with normal tools on the telephone\cite{ksl-snap-chat}.
