\section{File Deletion and Deleted File Recovery}\label{deleted_file_recovery}
Different file system implementations delete files in different ways.

Traditionally, file systems simply \emph{unlinked} files---the pointer
to the file was removed from the directory, and the blocks associated
with the file were returned to the free list.


\section{Exploiting File System Metadata}
File system metadata can be used to determine usage.

\section{Opportunities for hiding data in File Systems}

Information can be hidden in a file system by storing data in blocks
that are allocated but not used to hold content\cite{dfrws2005:KnutEcksteinAndMarkoJahnke}.
