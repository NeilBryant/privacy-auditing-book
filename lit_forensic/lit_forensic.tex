\chapter{Handling Digital Evidence}
The fundamental nature of digital information makes the practice of
digital forensics fundamentally different from other kinds of forensic
processes.  Whereas forensic scientists may have just a few drops of
blood or a few bullet fragments with which to work, digital data is
marked by its volume, the ease with which it may be copied, and the
ability to change it without a trace of the previous value.

Many mass storage systems have the some kind of \emph{hardware
  write-protect} that can be used to prevent accidental overwriting or
erasure. For example, 9-track tape features a
write-protection ring which, when removed, prevented the tape from
being written on, while $5\frac{1}{4}''$ floppy disks had notches cut into
the side that could be covered to inhibit writing. Early disk systems
also had hardware write-protect, but mass market hard drives that
became available in the mid 1980s did not have such a feature. As a
result, several approaches emerged to allow examination of digital
data while minimizing the chances of changing it: write
blockers, mirror drives, and forensic disk images.

\section{Write Blockers}

A write blocker is a device or program that provides a kind of
write-protection for a mass storage system by blocking attempts to
write to the media. Write blocking can be performed in hardware or
software. 

There are many different approaches to implementing a write
blocker. For example, a write blocker can allow \emph{read} commands
to pass while immediately returning an error condition when a
\emph{write} command is attempted. Alternatively the \emph{write}
commands may be executed on a different piece of media, sometimes
called a \emph{shadow drive}, giving the operating system the
appearance of a successful write while leaving the original media
undamaged.

Write blockers can be used to allow an examiner to directly examine
subject data on the original media. Alternatively, they can be used to allow the subject
data to be safely copied to a second piece of media called a
\emph{mirror drive}. It is important that the mirror drive be
\emph{cleared} before the copy is made to assure that there is no
\emph{cross-case contamination}, which happens when data are
inappropriately mixed between cases. Clearing is especially important
if the subject drive has errors or if the mirror drive is larger than
the subject drive.

\section{Disk Imagers}
The copy from the subject drive to the mirror drive is performed with
a program called a \emph{disk imager}.

\section{Digital Evidence Containers}

Mirror copies can be unwieldy to use, especially when the target
drives are very large. An added annoyance is that many drives contain
a large number of highly compressible data, such as sectors filled
with NULLs. Yet another problem is that there is no easy way to tell
if the copy is accurate or if the copy has been modified after it was
originally made.

\emph{Digital evidence containers} allow for digital evidence to be
copied into an archive that is \emph{compressed} (to allow for easier data
handling), \emph{integrity checked}  (so that the examiner can verify
the original data), \emph{annotated} with metadata such as the time
that the evidence was copied, the name of the investigator who created
the archive, the location where the copy was made, and other similar
information. Unlike ZIP or gzip files, these containers must also
allow for \emph{random access} their contents, as it would not be
efficient to decompress a multi-gigabyte data stream for the purpose
of accessing just a few sectors.

Additional requirements include \emph{Encryption}, so that access to
the evidence can be restricted to those that have a password or
decryption key; metadata specifically devoted to
\emph{chain-of-custody} and \emph{provenance}, so that the movement of
evidence through an organization or a forensic pipeline can be
electronically recorded; and \emph{external references}, so that the
evidence container can point to information present on other storage
systems. 

\section{File System Analysis and File Extraction}


\subsection{Files and File Systems}
The word \emph{file} is commonly used to describe a sequence of data
that is stored on a computer mass storage system. On modern computers
files are sequences of zero or more \emph{bytes}. Files have a length
that is set at any given point in time, but can be readily
changed. Files can have names and other associated \emph{metadata}
such as timestamps, an owner, and a group. Files have traditionally
been grouped together in
\emph{directories}\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_directory}. also
called \emph{folders}. 

The phrase \emph{File
  System}\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file} is
used to describe the part of the computer's operating
system that manages a storage system. However, the term is also used
to describe the very sectors on a mass storage device that contain the
files.

It is important to realize that files are an \emph{abstraction} that
was created for the purpose of managing data. There is nothing
inherent in the design of computers, operating systems or mass storage
devices that requires the use of files. A raw disk can be used as
virtual memory \emph{backing store} or as a storage system for a
database. Instead of stored as a sequence of bytes in a file, data can be stored as
objects that are persisted in memory, or as BLOBs in a database.

It is also important to realize that any computational storage device
or abstraction can be used to virtualize and contain any other storage
device. That is, a file can be stored in a file system, but a file
system can also be created and stored inside a file (this is
essentially what a disk image is). Most operating systems can swap to raw
partitions or to files, but file systems can also be created inside
RAM or virtual memory.

Adding to the complexity of the forensic examiner is
\emph{encryption}, which can be applied at the interface between any
of these abstractions. Encryption can be performed in the storage
device itself (as in the case of an encrypting hard drive), in the
disk driver, in the logical volume management system, in the file
system, or at the application level.

\subsection{File Systems of Forensic Interest}
There are a variety of different kinds of file systems in use on
modern computer systems:
\begin{description}
\item[Disk file systems] organize files and directories on
  block-oriented storage systems. These are of interest to those
  engaged in MEDEX operations. Popular file systems include FAT32
  (used primary on removable storage devices and camera cards), NTFS
  (Microsoft's New Technology File System), and HFS+ (Apple's
  Hierarchical File System used on Macs and iPhones).
\item[Distributed file systems] allow a computer to access
  information on remote servers as if it is stored
  locally. Distributed file systems are forensically interesting
  because many use local storage to cache information from the remote
  servers. Analyzing local storage can therefore give clues as to what
  was accessed remotely, and when it was accessed.
\item[Virtual file systems] use the file and directory abstraction to
  make it easy to access other information. For example, the Linux
  \url{/dev} file system is used to access devices through the file
  system, the \url{/sys} file system is used to access features within
  the system kernel, and the \url{/net} file system accesses the
  automounter. Virtual file systems are not typically of interest in
  MEDEX because they do not leave residual information on a storage
  device. However, virtual file systems are relevant in malware
  analysis and intrusion response.
\end{description}

As this chapter is written, specific file systems of interest include:
\begin{description}
\item[FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32] file systems developed by Microsoft for use with
  DOS. FAT refers to the File Allocation Table, an array of integers
  that is used to determine if a cluster is in use or free. (In FAT, a
  \emph{cluster} is a block of 1, 2, 4, 8 or more disk sectors.) The number
  refers to the size of the integers in the array (12 bits, 16 bits or
  32 bits). Today implementations of FAT are built in to practically every
  operating system, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, most digital
  cameras, and practically every other device with a USB or SD
  interface. 
\item[NTFS] 
\item[HFS+]
\item[YAFFS2]
\item[EXT2/3]
\item[EXT4]
\end{description}

Information can be hidden in a file system by storing data in blocks
that are allocated but not used to hold content\cite{dfrws2005:KnutEcksteinAndMarkoJahnke}.

\section{File Deletion and Deleted File Recovery}\label{deleted_file_recovery}
Different file system implementations delete files in different ways.

Traditionally, file systems simply \emph{unlinked} files---the pointer
to the file was removed from the directory, and the blocks associated
with the file were returned to the free list.

\chapter{Files, File Types, and File Type Identification}

In computer system engineering the term \emph{stream} is typically
used to denote a sequence of zero or more bytes that can be
sequentially accessed. The term \emph{file} is usually taken to mean a
sequence of zero or more bytes that is saved in some kind of storage
device so that it can be repeatedly accessed. 

Because files have zero or more bytes, every file inherently has a
\emph{file length}. The bytes are known as the \emph{file contents}. Together these are known as \emph{file
  properties}. 

There are other characteristics that we
commonly observe in files, such as file names, time stamps, owners,
\etc. \tabref{file-properties}  presents a list of file
properties seen on some operating systems. But it is easy to find counter examples of files that lack any
(or all) of the optional characteristics presented in
\tabref{file-properties}. As a result, all that we
can say about files definitively is that they have zero or more bytes,
they are \emph{written} (that is, a program can copy bytes from
the computer's memory into the file), and they can be \emph{read}
(the computer can copy bytes from the file back into main memory). At
their most basic level, files are persisted streams. 


\begin{table}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
Property & Description \\
\hline
\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textit{\small mandatory file properties:}}\\
File Contents & A sequence of bytes that makes up the file.\\
File Length   & The number of bytes in the \emph{file contents}.\\
\\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textit{\small optional file properties:}}\\
File Name & A sequence of 1 or more characters that can be used to reference the file. Files can have
zero, one, or multiple names.\\
Creation time (crtime) & The date and time when the file was created.\\
Modification time (mtime) & The date and time that the file's contents were last modified.\\
Access time (atime) & The date and time when a  byte of the file was last read.\\
Change time (ctime) & The date and time that the file's metadata was last modified. On Unix-based file systems
   the change time is frequently treated as if it were a creation time.\\
Inode number & Many file systems use a single integer to describe the location of a metadata block that provides a pointer to the file's contents. The block is called an \emph{inode} (index node).\\
Link Count (nlink) & On file systems that support \emph{hard links} (multiple names pointing at the same inode), the link count tracks the number of links.\\
Owner (uid) & The owner of a file is typically the operating system user that has the ability to change the file's properties. It is typically the creator of the file, although the owner can be changed.\\
Group (gid) & In addition to owners, most file systems allow a file to be put in one or more groups. Group membership can then be used to allow or prevent access to the file.\\
mode & Unix-based systems encode a ``mode'' in file system entries that are used to denote special files, such as those representing physical devices, FIFOs, sockets, and symbolic links.\\
Access Control Lists (ACLs) & An extended list of users and groups that are allowed (or disallowed) access to the file.
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Mandatory and optional file properties}\label{file-properties}
\end{table}

Files have been one of the primary abstractions provided by operating
systems for manipulating data for more than fifty years. Files are
the primary way that most computer information is stored, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Documents (\eg Microsoft Word Files, Adobe Acrobat files)
\item Digital photographs (\eg JPEG files)
\item Programs (\eg executables)
\item Databases (\eg Oracle database files, SQLite files)
\end{itemize}

As a result of their popularity, the identification, recovery and
manipulation of files is one of the primary tasks of computer
forensics. 

It's important to remember, however, that files are just
\emph{abstractions}---there is nothing inherent in the design of
memory or storage systems that dictates the use of files. Indeed,
there are many examples on modern computer systems of information that
is typically \emph{not} stored in files on a running computer system
(although the information, like any information, can be extracted and
stored in a file). Information that is typically not stored in files includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item The contents of RAM, including system memory and video memory.
\item CPU registers, the page translation table, and the translation
  lookaside buffer (TLB).
\item BIOS ROM or Flash RAM used for booting the computer.
\item Boot blocks on the mass storage device.
\item Partitions used for virtual memory. (Operating systems such
  as Unix traditionally swapped to a swap partition; only recently
  have operating systems started swapping to files.)
\item Partitions managed directly by a database. (Some databases
  directly access the raw storage to avoid the overhead of going
  through the file system.)
\end{itemize}

With the move to cloud-based services such as Facebook and Google
Docs, files are sure to become less important in computer forensics
over the next fifty years. This is because the storage on the client
will increasingly be used to cache information stored on a remote
server, and the information those servers will be stored in databases,
rather than in files.

Although a file is nothing more than a sequence of bytes, we typically
think about files in higher-level terms. 

\section{File Type}

The term \emph{file type} is commonly used to describe the format of
the data inside the file or the program that created it. However
because of an accident of history, we also think of a file's type as
being the file's \emph{extension}---that is, the three or four
characters that come after the final period in the file's name.

For example, digital cameras will create files with names like
\emph{DSC0001.JPG} that contain digital images. Most people think of
these files as ``JPEGs'' because the names end with the letters ``.jpg'' or
``.jpeg''.  But what really makes a file a JPEG is
its conformance to a format dictated by the Joint Photographic Experts
Group (JPEG)'s 1992 standard, known formally as ISO/IEC IS 10918-1 and
as ITU-T Recommendation T.81. That format defines a ``chunk-based''
container file format that begins with the byte sequence |FF D8| and
ends with the byte sequence |FF D9|.

Likewise, files created by Microsoft's popular Word file have the
extension ``.doc'' or ``.docx''. Some people call these files ``DOC''
or ``DOCX'' files. In fact, files created by Word with the ``.doc''
extension are typically byte streams formatting according to Microsoft's Object Linking and
Embedding (MSOLE) format; look inside these files and you will see data
structures reminiscent of the FAT32 file system. Files with the ``.docx'' extension are
typically ZIP compression archives that contain structured XML that is
interpreted by Word to display an editable word processing
document. (However, encrypted ``.docx'' files follow a different
standard altogether.)
Microsoft Excel uses the same MSOLE and ZIP formats when saving files
with the ``.xls'' and ``.xlsx'' extensions, respectively.

In practice, the phrase \emph{file type} can mean one of several things:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The file's \emph{extension}.} Early computer systems
  required that file names be in the format of eight characters, a
  period, and three characters. The three characters after the period
  are called the extension and were used on some computers to denote
  the program that was used to write and read the file. Microsoft
  Windows allowed extensions to be any length and directly associated
  application programs with extensions through the Windows Registry;
  double-clicking on a file's icon caused the application program
  registered for that file extension to run and open the file.
\item \textbf{The file's Internet media type (also known its MIME
  type).} The internet media type is a sequence of letters that are
  transmitted with every byte stream is that is downloaded over the
  Internet using the HTTP protocol. JPEG files are downloaded with the
  Internet media type ``image/jpeg''. \wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type}. 
\item \textbf{The file's \emph{magic numbers} or \emph{file
    header}}. Both terms are used to describe a sequence of bytes at the
  beginning of the file that hold information about the file and may
  be used to identify it in some way.
\end{itemize}

Closely related to file type are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The file's \emph{header}.
\item The file's \emph{footer}.
\end{itemize}

Let us explore each of these in turn and see how they influence
file type and interpretation when performing computer forensics.

\subsection{Magic Numbers}

The term \emph{magic number} is used to denote a constant byte or set
of bytes that typically appears at the beginning of a file. A common
magic number is the letters ``MZ'' denoting the start of a DOS or
Windows executable or Dynamic-Link Library (DLL). The SQLite database
uses the 15 letters ``SQLite format 3'' as its magic number. Magic numbers are
thus not really numbers, but actually sequences of characters. ``MZ'' has
the numeric value 23117 or 19802 depending on whether one is using
little-endian or big-endian math (\figref{calc-mz}). (Even though the
string ``SQLite format 3'' has a numeric value, it would never be used
in practice.)

\begin{figure}
\begin{Verbatim}
>>> ord('M') | ord('Z')<<8
23117
>>> hex(23117)

>>> hex(19802)
'0x4d5a'
\end{Verbatim}
\caption{Computing the decimal and hex values of the character
  sequence ``MZ'' in little-endian and big-endian format with
  Python.}\label{calc-mz}
\end{figure}

While some file formats require magic numbers, others do not. Files in
the Hyper Text Markup Language originally were supposed to begin with
the string ``|<html|'' and nowadays should begin with the string
``|<!DOCTYPE|'', but most web browsers will do their best to display
any text as HTML if they detect HTML tags.

software and processed by covert-communications programs.

\subsubsection{Stegnagraphy with Chunk-Based Files}
Create new chunk types that will be ignored.

Hide information at the end of each chunk.

Danger is that some programs may look for such data (or even error),
so it's important to test. It may be desirable to encrypt the data and
include cover data that gives the impression that the text is
legitimately placed there by a program that the analyst simply doesn't
have access to. For example, a new chunk type containing a string such
as ``gamma correction'' or ``color calibration.''

\subsubsection{Stegnagraphy with Directory-Based Files}

ZIP and PDF.

Store information in regions not associated with files.

Embed new file types that are ignored.

\subsubsection{Traditional Stegnography}
Finally, multi-media files can be used for traditional
stegnaraphy. For example, the bottom bits of a picture can be used to
encode another image....



\section{File Type Identification}

Because we do not have a really firm definition for ``file type,''
it's not clear what's meant by file type identification. Do we mean
finding an application that can ``open'' a file? Do we mean being able
to extract the content from a file so that it can be viewed/indexed/processed?

\section{Carving Algorithms and Applications}
In computer forensics we use the term  ``carving'' to describe the
process of searching for data based on its content, rather than
retrieving data based on metadata or other kinds of extrinsic
information. Carving is one of the primary techniques for recovering deleted
files and it is widely used both in computer forensics and (more
broadly) in data recovery.

File carving consists of three distinct steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{Step (\arabic{enumi})}
\item The bytes that make up a file are \emph{identified}.
\item The identified bytes are \emph{validated}.\label{step-validate}
\item The validated bytes are \emph{saved}.\label{step-save}
\end{enumerate}

In the next section we will walk step-by-step through the design and
implementation of a simple carver. We will then explore ways to
improve the carver's performance. A carving taxonomy appears in
\tabref{carving_taxonomy}. Approaches for carving fragmented files is
discussed in \secref{carving-fragmented}. Finally, this chapter will
explore carving structured objects other than files such as network
packets and multimedia data.

\section{Simple File Carving of Contiguous Files}
\subsection{Carving JPEGs: An Example}

To see how carving works in practice, consider the quintessential 
example of carving digital JPEG photographs.

The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) digital image format is
widely used for the storage and transmission of digitized
photographs. JPEG files are comprised of several segments that include
a header, a color table, a set of Huffman encoded data, and a footer,
and may also include icons and EXIF data
(\figref{art/carving_jpeg}). (The JPEG format will be described in
more detail in \Sref{jpeg-format}.) What makes carving JPEG files
easily is the fact that JPEG files begin with one of two
characteristic four-byte-headers and end with a characteristic
two-byte-footer. Thus, it is possible to scan a disk image for any
occurrence of the four-byte-header that is followed by the
two-byte-footer, and write the four-byte sequence, the intervening
bytes, and the two-byte sequence into a file. This file \emph{may} be
a JPEG; you can find out by giving the file a |.jpg| extension and
double-clicking on it. And while it is true that the four-byte-footer
will occur by chance in random data, the chance is actually quite
small---just $\frac{2}{4,294,967,296}=\frac{1}{2,147,483,648}$. This
translates to roughly 500 false positives on a terabyte drive.

Here is a very simple JPEG carver written in Python:

\begin{figure}
{\small
\lstset{language=python}
\lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\footnotesize,
  showstringspaces=false]{carving/demo_carver.py}
}
\caption{A simple JPEG carver}\label{jpeg-carver}
\end{figure}

The carver takes a single argument, the name of a raw disk image to
carve. It maps the entire file into memory and starts searching for
the  3-byte JPEG common header (|FF D8 FF|). If the string is found the carver then searches
for the JPEG footer (|FF D9|). If the footer is found the header, the
footer, and the bytes between them are saved. Since there is no way
for the program to know the original file name, the JPEG is given the
name |savefileN.jpg| where |N| starts at 1 and increases. The process
then repeats. This approach is called header/length carving.

Running this program on the disk image \emph{nps-2009-canon2-gen6.raw}
finds 68 so-called JPEGs. You can then click on each one and see if it
is a valid file; throw the ones that are not valid into the
trash. Essentially, the computer has implemented carving step 1, the
identification, while the user is performing the validation
(\ref{step-validate}) and deciding what to save
(\ref{step-save}). \figref{carving/carving_files} shows the first 12
files recovered. The disk \emph{canon2-gen6} disk image was specially
created to test JPEG carving programs. As can be seen from
\figref{jpeg-carver}, some files can be recovered in
their entirety, while others can only be recovered in part, and some
are strangely corrupted.

An alternative to header/footer carving is header/length carving. With
this approach the carver identifies the header, then decodes the
header (and possibly other structures) to determine the length of the
original file. Microsoft OLE files can be identified with
Header/Length carving, as the files begin with a characteristic header
that points to a table that can be used to infer the length of the
OLE file. (Microsoft OLE files do not have a characteristic footer.)

ZIP files contain both a characteristic header and a characteristic
footer. Information in the footer can be used to determine the length
of the original ZIP file if the header is missing. Thus ZIP files can
be recovered using footer/length carving.


\sgraphic{carving/carving_files}{The first 12 files recovered using
  the carver shown in \figref{jpeg-carver}}

The file recovery program Lazarus\cite{lazarus} appears to be the
first publicly available file carver. Lazarus took each 1KiB or 2KiB
block of a partition to be recovered and saved it in a file, then
analyzed the file with the Unix \emph{file} command. If the file's
type matched a desired type, Lazarus extended the file with
additional blocks from the file system as long as the new blocks had
similar entropy characteristics as the first block. Although slow and
inefficient, this process worked to recover a variety of graphic file
formats.

The Defense Computer Forensics Lab developed a carving program called
CarvThis in 1999.  That program inspired Special Agent Kris Kendall to
develop a proof-of-concept carving program in March 2001 called
\emph{snarfit}. Special Agent Jesse Kornblum joined Kendall while both
were at the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the
resulting program, Foremost, was released as an open source carving
tool. 

Richard and Roussev reimplemented Foremost the program with the goal of
enhancing performance and decreasing memory usage. The resulting tool
was called Scalpel~\cite{scalpel}. Scalpel version 1.60 was
released in December 2006.

Foremost and Scalpel use a configuration file that defines
the headers and footers of each file type to be carved. When the
headers and footers are found they and the data between them are saved
in a file with the given extension; the program also produces a
detailed report
indicating the location from which each file was recovered.

\subsection{How not to Improve the Carver}
In practical, the simple header/footer carving implemented by Foremost
and Scalpel (as well as our python example) generate a large number of
invalid files---what we term \emph{false positives} above. So after
the first carvers were created, their developers immediately set about
to improve their performance by decreasing the amount of false
positives returned.

Carving can be thought of as a recognition task. The disk image is
filled with byte runs. A certain number of those runs are the desired
files; the rest are not. Carving can therefore be thought of as a
\emph{recognition task} and evaluated accordingly. The \emph{recall}
of a carver is the percentage of files in the disk image that are
properly identified; the \emph{precision}  is the percentage of
recognized files that are actually the desired file type. Ideally we
would like recall and accuracy to both be 100\%. The simple carver
described above has a recall rate of 100\% for contiguous files but
0\% for fragmented files, and a precision that is determined by
occurrence of headers and footers in the data that are not associated
with intact files.

At first blush, there are two obvious ways to improve the simple carving
algorithm presented above. Both are wrong:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Most file systems store the first byte of
each file aligned with a disk sector, so the carving programs can be
configured to ignore the four-byte-header if the header does not start on a
sector boundary.

\item Most JPEGs are smaller than 15 megabytes, so if the
distance between the four-byte-header and the two-byte-footer is more
than 15 megabytes (or, in practice, any user-configurable threshold),
the header can be ignored. 

\end{enumerate}

These approaches are wrong because they impact carver
performance both negatively (by decreasing the recall rate) and
unnecessarily (because there are alternatives that do not impact
recall rate).

In the first case, even though file systems like NTFS start
files on block boundaries, JPEGs may be present in many locations
other than files. JPEG's can be stored as BLOBs in databases; they can
be stored ZIP archive (ZIP detects that the JPEG file is compressed
and will insert it in the archive without further compression); it can
be emebdded in a Microsoft Word |.doc| or |.docx| file. JPEGs can even
be embedded in other JPEG files as icons. In each of these cases, each
JPEG header will have a $\frac{511}{512}=99.8\%$ chance of \emph{not}
starting on a block boundary. Thus, restricting carving to block
boundaries may cause the analyst to ignore many files of forensic
import. (Indeed, there are cases in which the JPEG itself could not be
recovered, but important information recovered from the JPEG's 
embedded icon).

Restricting the size of the recovered file can also be
problematic. While most JPEG files are indeed smaller than 15
megabytes, some are not. It would be unfortunate indeed if a carving
tool failed to find a huge, high-resolution on a subject disk simply
because the examiner did not believe that there were any large JPEGs
to be found!

\sgraphic{art/carving_jpeg}{The internal structure of a JPEG file
  contains a header that starts with the bytes \texttt{FF D8 FF E0} or
  \texttt{FF D8 FF E1} followed by an optional Icons and EXIF section,
  followed by a color table, the huffman encoded image data, and
  finally a footer that ends with the bytes \texttt{FF D9}.}


Despite this analysis, these are in fact the data reduction strategies
implemented by both Foremost and Scalpel. That is, they allow the user
to specify a maximum file size and whether or not to carve files that
are not on block boundaries. The authors of the carvers took this
approach rather than developing alternative approaches for increasing
precision.

them to the validator.

files out of raw data using a distinct header (start of file marker)
and a maximum (file) size. This approach works because many file
formats (e.g. JPEG, MP3) do not care if additional data is appended to
the end of a valid file.

\item[Header/Embedded Length Carving] Some file formats (MSOLE, ZIP) have distinctive headers that indicate
the start of the file, but have no such distinctive flag for the
end. This approach starts by scanning the image file for sectors that can be
identified as the start of the file. These sectors are taken as the
\emph{seeds} of objects. The seeds are then grown one sector at a
time, with each object being passed to the validator, until the
validator returns the length of the object or a \verb+V_ERR+,
indicating that a complete file does not exist. If an embedded length
is found, this information is used to create a test object for
validation. Once an object is found with a given start sector, the
carver moves to the next sector.

footer. For byte-at-a-time formats that do not have obvious footers, the files can 
be trimmed a character at time until the file no longer validates; the last
trimmed byte is the re-appended to the file.  Alternatively, the files
can be read with a data flow system; bytes that are read can be trimmed.

\section{Object Validation}

A better approach for reducing false positives and therefore
increasing precision is to parse the carved
object and determine if it is in fact a valid file. This process is
call \emph{object validation}. For performance reasons it is best
to apply object validation after
content is selected from the carving target but before it is saved to
a file. In practice, however, many authors have created two-stage
carving systems where the first stage employs a traditional carver
such as Scalpel and the second stage uses object validation to delete
the false positives and thus improve precision. 

Validation is best performed in multiple layers. An initial ``fast
validation'' step can rapidly verify a file's internal
structures. Objects that pass the fast validation step can be
subjected to a 

\subsection{Fast Object Validation of Container Structures}


Many files of forensic interest are in fact \emph{container files}
that can have several internal sections. For example, JPEG files 
contain metadata, color tables, and finally the Huffman-encoded image~\cite{jpeg-format}.
ZIP files contain a directory and multiple compressed files~\cite{zip-format}. Microsoft
Word files contain a Master Sector Allocation Table (MSAT), a Sector
Allocation Table (SAT), a Short Sector Allocation Table (SSAT) a
directory, and one or more data streams~\cite{msole-format}. All of
these structures have integers
and pointers; validating these requires little more than checking to
see if an integer is within a predefined range or if a pointer points
to another valid structure. 

For example the first sector of an Office file contains a CDH header.
The CDH must contain a hex {\tt FE} as the 29th character and a {\tt
FF} as the 30th character; these bytes are ideal candidates for Header 
validation. Once a candidate CDH is found, the pointers can be
interpreted. If any of these numbers are negative or larger than the
length of the object divided by 512, the CDH is not valid, and a
Microsoft Office file validator can reject the object. Checking these
and other structures inside an object can be very fast if the entire
object is resident in memory.

Information in the container structures can also provide guidance to
the carver. For example, when a candidate CDH is found in the drive
image, the values of the MSAT and SSAT pointers can be used to place a
lower bound on the size of the file --- if the MSAT points to sector
1000, then the file must be at least 512,000 bytes long. Being able to
set a lower bound is not important when performing Header/Maximum File
Size carving (\secref{header/maximum}), but it is important when
performing Fragment Recovery Carving (\secref{recovery-carving}).

Container structure validation is more likely than Header/Footer
validation to detect incorrect
byte sequences or sectors inside the object being validated because
more bytes are examined. But we have seen many examples of
carving candidates
that have valid container structures but which
nevertheless cannot be opened by Microsoft Word---or which open in
Microsoft Word but then display text that is obviously wrong. 

The time spent on fast
validation is insignificant compared to decompression, and an object
that fails fast validation will not need to be decompressed or
rendered, a performance win. JPEGs can be rapidly validated by
verifying their chunk-based structure. ZIP files can be validated by
verifying that each of the central directory entries point to
appropriate local headers. Office files can be validated by verifying
their internal structure.

Mikus added fast validation of Microsoft OLE files to Foremost while
working on his master's thesis at the Naval Postgraduate
School~\cite{mikus}. Sadly, the code was not ported to Scalpel. 



\subsection{Validation by Decompression}
\sgraphic{carving/mars-partial}{}
Once the container structures are validated, the next step is to
validate the actual data that is contained. This is more
computationally intensive, but in many cases it will discover internal
inconsistencies that allow the validator to reject the candidate object.

For example, the last section of a JPEG-formatted file consists of a
Huffman-coded representation of the picture. If this section cannot be
decompressed, the picture cannot be displayed and the object can be
deemed invalid. A computationally intensive way to do this is by
decompressing the picture; a faster way is by examining all
of the Huffman symbols and checking to see if they are valid or not.

The text sections of a Microsoft Office file can likewise be extracted
and used for validation. If the text is not valid---for example, if it
contains invalid characters---then the object validator rejects.


The JPEGs shown in \figref{art/carving_jpeg} are validated by
attempting to render them using the JPEG viewer embedded in the
Macintosh operating system. The decompression algorithm used to
display JPEGs has the property that invalid data can be detected
because it cannot be decompressed. Thus, a JPEG that is truncated can
frequently be displayed up to the point of corruption, as shown in
\figref{art/carving_jpeg}. But it is important to note that simple
decompression is not sufficient for validation, since there are
byte sequences that will decompress but which are clearly not
correct (\figref{carving/mars-partial}).

\cite{memon:sht} observed that the obvious errors in JPEGs such as
\figref{carving/mars-partial} can be used as a signal that a block is
not part of the JPEG, even though no error is encountered in
decompressing. The algorithm works by computing the the color change
between successive scan lines of the JPEG. 


\section{Carving Fragmented Files}

Until now we have only discussed carving of files that are
contiguous---that is, files that are written to the disk as an
uninterrupted sequence of bytes in adjacent sectors. A more serious
problem is that files can be \emph{fragmented}. That is, a single file
can be split into two or more pieces that are then stored in
non-consecutive locations on a hard drive. Although fragmenting a file
significantly decreases file system performance (even for solid state
drives), a file system might fragment a file because the file is
written in pieces, or because there is no available space on the hard
drive to store the file, or even because of a poor file system
implementation.

File fragmentation is a serious problem for many file carvers because
there is no obvious way to reassemble the various fragments into
intact files without the use of file system metadata. Consider
\figref{art/carving_gap}: whereas carving a file with a single
fragment requires only identifying the file's starting and ending
sectors, carving a file that is fragmented in two pieces requires solve for four
unknowns: $s_1$, $e_1$, $s_2$ and $e_2$. 

\sgraphic{art/carving_gap}{A JPEG that is fragmented in two piece
  consists of a header that begins at sector $s_1$, the end of the
  first fragment at sector $e_1$, a gap, the start of the second
  fragment at sector $s_2$, and the JPEG's footer at sector
  $e_2$. Note that if $s_2-e_1=\textrm{gap}$ is positive if the second fragment is on the
  disk after the first fragment, and negative if the second fragment
  is on the disk \emph{before} the first fragment. In Bifragment Gap Carving the sectors $s_1$ and $e_2$ are
  known; the carver must find $e_1$ and $s_2$.}


To date three algorithms have been described for fragment recovery
carving:

\subsubsection{Bifragment Gap Carving}\label{gap-carving}

If a region of sectors in a disk image begins with a valid header and
ends with a valid footer but does not validate, one possibility is
that the file was in fact fragmented into two or more pieces
and that the header and footer reside in different fragments.
In the Garfinkel corpus there are 
many cases of bifragmented files where the gap between the first
fragment and the second is a relatively small number of
disk sectors. 

The 2006 Challenge contained several instances of JPEG files that
were in two fragments, with one or more sectors of junk inserted in
the middle. Aside from the large number of fragmented files in the
challenge and the fact that the gap size was rarely an integral power of
two, the scenario was quite realistic. 

To carve this kind of scenario Garfinkel developed \emph{split
carving}, an approach which involves assembling repeated trial
objects from two or more sector runs to form candidate objects which
are then validated. Here we present an improved algorithm for split carving, which
was call \emph{bifragment gap carving} (\figref{art/carving_gap}):

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Let $f_1$ be the first fragment that extends
from sectors $s_1$ to $e_1$ and $f_2$ be the second fragment that
extends from sectors $s_2$ to $e_2$. 
\item Let $g$ be the size of the gap between the two fragments, that
  is, $g=s_2-(e_1+1)$.
\item Starting with $g=1$, try all gap sizes until $g=e_2-s_1$
\item For every $g$, try all consistent values of $e_1$ and $s_2$. 
\end{itemize}

Essentially, this algorithm places a gap between the start and the end
flags, concatenating the sector runs on either side of the gap, and
growing the gap until a validating sequence is found. This algorithm
is $O(n^2)$ for carving a single object for file formats that have
recognizable header and footer; it is $O(n^4)$ for finding all
bifragmented objects of a particular type in a target, since every
sector must be examined to determine if it is a header or not, and
since any header might be paired with any footer.

\subsection{Bifragment Carving with Constant Size and Known Offset}

Bifragmented MSOLE documents cannot be carved with gap carving because there is no
recognizable footer. However, the CDH can be recognized. 
Recall that the CDH has a pointer that points to
the MSAT and the SAT. Because the CDH is the first sector of the file
it always appears in the first fragment. If the MSAT occurs in the
second fragment (and it frequently does, because the MSAT tends to be
written near the end of the MSOLE file), then it is actually possible
to find this self-referential sector by examining every sector in the
disk image. (There is a small probability that a sector will
match by chance, but the probability is quite small.)

We have developed a carver that makes use of this information to find
and recover MSOLE files that are fragmented in this fashion. The
carver starts with $s_1$, the address of a CDH, and uses the
information in the header to find $m_1$, the first block of the
MSAT. From $m_1$ the carver can determine $L$, the length of the final
file, as well as the sector offset within the file where $m_1$ must
necessary appear (\figref{msatcarving}).

The carver now employs an algorithm similar to gap carving except that
the two independent variables are the number of sectors in the first
fragment and the starting sector of the second fragment. The length of
the two fragments must sum to $L$ and the second fragment must include
sector $m_1$. This carving algorithm is $O(n^3)$ if the CDH location
is known and the MSAT appears in the second fragment, and $O(n^4)$ if
the forensic analyst desires to find all bifragmented MSOLE files in
the disk image. A variant of this algorithm can be used if the MSAT is
in the first fragment and portions of the SAT (which is not
contiguous) are in the second fragment. We saw both of these cases in
the 2006 Challenge.

If the entire SAT is within the first fragment, the second fragment
must be found by validating individual data objects within the
Microsoft compound document. This case did not appear in the 2006
Challenge.


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{carving/msatcarving}
\caption{In Bifragment Carving with Constant Size and Known Offset the
sectors $s_1$ and $m_1$ and $f_1+f_2$ are known; the carver must find
$e_1$, $s_2$ and $e_2$.}\label{msatcarving}
\end{figure}

Applying this carver to the 2006 Challenge we were able to recover all of the Microsoft Word
and Excel files that were split into two pieces. However, in one case
we had numerous false positives---files that would open in Microsoft Word but
which obviously contained incorrect data. The files opened in Word
because our MSOLE validator was able to produce file objects that
contained valid CDH, MSAT, SAT and SSAT, but which still had
substituted internal sectors. Some of the files opened instantly in
Word while others took many tens of seconds to open. However, the
number of file positives was low, and we were able to manually
eliminate the incorrect ones.

One of the Office files in the  challenge was in three pieces. Using
two of these fragments Our carver produced a file that could be opened
in Word and that contained most but not all of the text. Using this
text we were able to locate a source file on the Internet that was
similar but not identical to the file in the Carving
challenge. However, enough of the 512-byte sectors were the same that
we were able to determine the outlines of the three fragments. We then
manually carved these three fragments into a single file, opened it,
and verified that it was correct.


\section{Hash Based Carving}

\subsubsection{Hash-Based  Carving with frag\_find}\label{hash-based}
Carving is traditionally defined in computer forensics as the
searching for data objects based on \emph{content}, rather than
following pointers in metadata\cite{garfinkel:carving07}. Traditional
carvers operate by searching for headers and footers; some carvers
perform additional layers of object validation. Hash-based carving, in
contrast, searches a disk for ``master'' files already in a corpus by
performing sector-by-sector hash comparisons.

\newcommand{\master}{\textbf{master}\xspace}
%\newcommand{\image}{\textbf{image}\xspace}
\newcommand{\filemap}{\texttt{filemap}\xspace}
\newcommand{\shamap}{\texttt{shamap}\xspace}
We have developed a tool called |frag_find| that achieves high-speed
performance on standard hardware. Here we describe the algorithm using
the terminology proposed by Dandass
\etal~\cite{dandass2008,collange2009}, although our algorithm 
does not require their hardware-based acceleration techniques that
are the basis of their research:

\begin{compactenum}
\item For each \master file a \filemap data structure is created that
  can map each master file sector to a set of sectors in the image
  file. A separate \filemap is created for each master.
\item Every sector of each master file is scanned. For each sector the
  MD5 and SHA-1 hashes are computed. The
MD5 code is used to set a corresponding bit in a $2^{24}$ bit
Bloom filter. The SHA-1 codes are stored in a data structure called
the \shamap that maps SHA-1 codes to one or more sectors in which that
hash code is found. 
\item Each sector of the image file is scanned. For each sector
  the MD5 hash is computed and the corresponding bit checked in
  the Bloom filter. This operation can be done at nearly disk
  speed. Only when a sector's MD5 is found in the Bloom filter is
  the sector's SHA-1 calculated. The \shamap structure is consulted;
  for each matching sector found in the \shamap, the sector number of
  the IMAGE file is added to the corresponding
  sector in each master \filemap.
\item Each \filemap is scanned for the longest runs of
  consecutive image file sectors. This run is noted and then removed from
  the \filemap. The process is repeated until the \filemap contains no
  more image file sectors. 
\end{compactenum}

Our hash-based carving algorithm covers both fragmented master files and the
situation where portions of a master are present in multiple locations
in the image file.

Our original hash-based carving implementation used
Adler-32\cite{RFC1950} instead of MD5 as the fast hash, but subsequent
testing found that most MD5 implementations are actually faster than
most Adler-32 implementations due to extensive hand-optimization that
the MD5 implementations have received. Although the new algorithm
could dispense with SHA-1 altogether and solely use MD5, the MD5
algorithm is known to have deficiencies. If the results of hash-based
carving are to be presented in a court of law, it is preferable to use
SHA-1. To further speed calculation we found it useful to precompute
the SHA-1 of the NULL-filled sector; whenever the system is asked to
calculate the value of this sector, this value is used instead.

We prefer to use \emph{sectors} for hash-based
carving because they are the minimum allocation unit of the disk
drive. Larger block sizes are more efficient, but larger blocks
complicate the algorithm because of data alignment and partial write
issues. As a result, hash-based carving may fail to identify valid
data when used with block sizes larger than the sector size.


\section{Carving Challenges}

Carrier, Casey and Venema created the 2006 DFRWS Carving Challenge
to spur innovation in carving
algorithms~\cite{dfrws2006-challenge}. The Challenge consisted of a
49,999,872 byte ``challenge file'' containing data blocks from text
files, Microsoft office files, JPEG files, and ZIP 
archives, but having no file system metadata such as inodes or
directory entries. Some of the files in the Challenge were
contiguous, while others were split into two or three fragments. The
goal was to reconstruct the original files
that had been used to create the challenge.

\section{Large Scale Forensics}
% DFXML

Scalability is a fundamental problem with computer forensics
practice. Practitioners have no control over the systems that they
analyze: while many criminals use computers that are a few years old,
some criminals will use top-of-the-line computer systems. Thus,
examiners are frequently in the position of being forced to analyze
top-of-the-line systems with their own systems that are either
top-of-the-line or a few years out of date. This creates what
\citeN{dfrws2004:DrGoldenGRichardIII} 
termed the \emph{performance wall}---no matter how well software is
written, it will never be able to analyze a suspect's system in a
reasonable amount of time. The solution, Richard argued, is a
distributed digital forensics framework---a system that both stores
data and performs analysis in a distributed fashion.

\section{Preservation and Archiving}

\emph{Explaint he problem}

Significant work has been done on the development of file types for
long term preservation and archiving. The Library of Congress has a
major Digital Preservation effort
[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/] with a collection of recommended
formats for long term archives.  The National Archives and Records
Administration has an initiative to assist agencies in developing
“selecting sustainable formats for electronic records.” 

Unfortunately, much of the work that has been done by LoC and NARA is
for authoring of digital content and is therefore less appropriate for
forensics efforts.

What we require of a long-term file archiving format:

\begin{description}
\item[Public specification] so that we understand all of the bytes that are stored in each data object.
\item[Open source implementation]— ideally multiple implementations so that they can be cross-validated — so that in the future we will be able to create new software that can read our legacy documents.
\item[Widespread Adoption and Use]  As indicated by NARA, “Formats adopted for widespread use have a higher probability of being sustainable over time.”   
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[ASCII text files] with lines delimited by |\r\n|
\item[UNICODE files] in UTF-8	(Unicode defines an end-of-line semantics)
\item[Avoid HTML] it’s not clear how it would be displayed.)

NARA recommends digital photographic records in TIFF II format version 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0, or in JPEG format. 
Given the wide support for GIF, PNG, and JPEG file formats, it makes sense to accept these types for exploited images. Windows currently does not support JPEG2000, so this type should not be accepted. GIF and PNG are lossless compression algorithms.

Audio:
NARA recommends that archived audio be in Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF), Uncompressed Waveform audio format (WAV), Audio Format (AU), Uncompressed Broadcast Wave Format (BWF), Free format Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), or Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) 4 Audio Lossless Coding format (ALS). In all cases NARA prefers an audio recording depth of 24 bits per sample, with a minimum depth of 16 bits per sample, and a sampling rate of 96 Khz with a minimum sampling rate of 44.1 KHz.  NARA’s recommendations are clearly driven by the decide to create an national archive record. 

For archiving exploited audio, it makes sense to store the original audio and a playback audio. Audio is relatively small in size compared to video, imposing little penalty for storing the original files. A copy should also be made in an archive format to assure longterm playability of the captured media. 

•	MPEG4 ALS. (Currently there are relatively few products that support MPEG4 ALS, but this is expected to change over time
. Ffmpeg currently supports MPEG4 ALS.)

Video:

NARA finds Audio-Visual Interleave Format (AVI), Material Exchange Format (MXF), and Quicktime Format (MOV) to be preferred audio formats, and recommends lossless codes such as Motion JPEG 2000 or HuffyUV. When these are not practical, NARA suggests using MPEG2, MPEG4, DV or MJPEG2000 lossy codecs.

Datamining can be used to find evidence that is inconsistent

\citeN{dfrws2005:BrianDCarrierAndEugeneHSpafford} used outlier
analysis to find files that were inconsistent with others. For
example, when attackers replace files in the \emph{/bin} directory
with altered versions, it is typical for the attacker to reset the
file's modification timestamp to match the original. However, other
metadata is harder to match, such as the file's inode number or even
its physical location on the drive.  Carrier and Spafford's approach
would find such files, although they did not report the number of
false positives that the technique generated based on typical
operating system use.
