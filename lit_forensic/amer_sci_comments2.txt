At the end of the piece, there is not really a strong conclusion to finish your narrative. Do you think you could add a sentence or two that would sum things up a bit? Something about the current state of the field, what's up and coming, why things might be looking up, etc? Perhaps something about the fact that there will always be an arms race between criminals and investigators, but new tools hope to make it possible for law enforcement to stay a step ahead? 

Let me know what you think. I'm happy to help in any way possible.

Best,
Fenella

Fenella,

Thanks for the email. 

Thanks for the references in this case. Will you be sending me more detailed comments on the article, or should I just put through another draft with more examples?

Hi Simson,

I hope you had a happy new year.

As I mentioned when we spoke on the phone, I thought you might want to consider this example to possibly add to your article, about a murder case where the cellphone of the victim was accidentally erased by police. In the same case, there was also some interesting testimony regarding the timestamp on a computer.  The man was eventually convicted of murdering his wife, although I understand that appeals are ongoing.

Here is the main article of interest:
