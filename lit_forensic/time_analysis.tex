\chapter{Time Analysis}

There are at least two
fundamentally different issues regarding the accuracy and precision of
time measurements in digital forensics. The first pertains to the accuracy of
the time stamps on the subject media; the second pertains to the
accuracy of the examiner's time reference. Accurately knowing either
of these measurements requires some way of tracing time measurements
back to a time standard or Root Time Authority (RTA)\cite{dfrws2002:MichaelDuren}.
