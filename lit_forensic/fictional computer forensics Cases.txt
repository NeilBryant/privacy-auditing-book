: Captain James T. Kirk is tried for the wrongful death of Lt. Commander Ben Finney. Computer tapes show that Finney was in one of the Enterprise's "ion pods" that Capt. Kirk jettisoned during a yellow alert. It turns out that Finney faked his death and altered the ship's computer in an attempt to frame Kirk. Spock discovers this because the alternation to the computer also impacts its ability to play chess: instead of playing the computer to a draw, Spock is now able to beat it.
