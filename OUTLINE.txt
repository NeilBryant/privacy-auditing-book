Title: Technical Privacy Auditing with Computer Forensics Tools

Part 1 -  Privacy Auding: Task and Tools

Chapter 1 - Introduction
 - What is Privacy Auditing?
 - What is Computer Forensics?
 - What are Computer Forensics Tools?
 - What is Personally Identifiable Information?
   - Legal definitions
   - Practical definitions
   - Practical Concerns
     - Reuse of identifiers - at the same time, at different times
     - Shared IDs
     - specificity of identifiers; birthday problem
     - IP addresses
   - Identifiers: IPv4, IPv6, Mobile ID, SIM cards, Phone #s, email addressses
   - GUIDs and identifiers
 - "Unique"
 - Unnoticed data leakage - why it's a problem
 - Example: Blacked out text in PDFs
   - Senate committee
   - EEOC
 - Detecting data leakage is an experimental science
 - Detecting data leakage is like proving a negative

Chapter 2 - What Data Looks Like
 - Make a PDF in Microsoft Word that has leaked data.
 - ASCII and Unicode
 - Hex Dump
 - Strings
 - base64
 - Magic Numbers

Chapter 3 - Designing a good forensics experiment
 - Why experiment?
 - What is the purpose of the experiment? - what you can provide and what you can't
 - Start with a wipe
 - Use Self-Identifying Data
 - Sampling vs. Complete Analysis

Chapter - Operational Concerns
- Where do names come from?
 - PII in distribution software
   - @real.com
   - "Trolltech" - where are the naems from?
- Owner data.
- Correspondent data
- Triage


Part 2 - Working with Documents and Files

Chapter - Private Data in PDFs
- Improperly redacted data
- High-resolution JPEGs
- Metadata

- Simple Carving
- hash-based carving/ frag_find

Part 4 - Working with RAM

Part 5 - Network Analysis
- Simple diagram of how the Internet works
  user->facebook->user
  user->laptop->facebook->laptop->user
                        ->phone->user
- IP addresses
  - Are they PII?
  - How do they change over time?
- Email Analysis
  - webmail vs. client mail
  - Reading Email headers; header: blue / yellow
  - show where email header comes from
  - Show how email pics up headers as it moves through the system
- Web Analysis
  - cookies and other identifiers
- Facebook & Twitter
- How personal information gets embedded as people communicate over the cloud.
- Working with packets
  - tcpflow
  - using the MD5 option to see when the same data is sent more than once



Part 6 - Correlation and Re-Identification
- Differences in cameras
- Differences in writing styles


Part 6 - Visualziing what you Find
