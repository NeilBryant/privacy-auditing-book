Hi

but the thing is in the pdf file it is written that there is 1 .E01 file and 1 .AFF file 
so I was little confused..

but it worked to creat a raw "dd" file with FTKs imager.
and  both sluthkit and FTK could read that "dd"...
and it also created the md5.. and so...

TANXS   for the answer !!!
  
================
Working with large amounts of data:

- ZIP vs. ZIP64
- 7zip
I hope you had a happy new year.

As I mentioned when we spoke on the phone, I thought you might want to consider this example to possibly add to your article, about a murder case where the cellphone of the victim was accidentally erased by police. In the same case, there was also some interesting testimony regarding the timestamp on a computer.  The man was eventually convicted of murdering his wife, although I understand that appeals are ongoing.

Here is the main article of interest:
