\sgraphic{art/TK}{Most mass storage systems, including hard drives (HDs),
  solid state drives (SSDs), and Secure Digital (SD) cards, store data
  in blocks of data, sometimes called \emph{sectors}}

Most kinds of computer data are eventually turned into \emph{files}
and stored on some kind of
\emph{mass storage device} (\figref{art/TK}). At the most basic level a file is
nothing more than a sequence of zero or more bytes. In practice files
have additional properties such as a \emph{file name}, 
\emph{creation date}, \emph{modification date}, \emph{last access
  data}, and so on. These other properties are called \emph{metadata},
a word that loosely means ``data about other data.''

Mass storage systems don't store files. Instead, they store blocks of
bytes (sometimes called \emph{sectors}). These blocks are invariably
sized as an even power of 2. In the 1990s most hard drives had a block
size of 512 bytes and Compact Discs (CDs) had a block size of 2048
bytes; modern hard drives have a block size of 4096 bytes. A 1~TB
drive in a computer laptop would therefore have approximately 250
million 4096-byte blocks. Each block on the media is referenced
by a distinct number called a \emph{logical block address} (LBA). Most
mass storage systems are \emph{random access}, meaning that the
computer can read or write any block in any order, although it is
invariably faster to read or write blocks multiple blocks at a time in numeric order.

Of course, users don't see blocks of bytes when they take an SD card
out of a camera and try to read it on their laptop: they see folders
and files. The  translation between the mass storage system's blocks
of bytes and the files that are shown on the computer's screen is
performed by a piece of code inside the operating system called the
\emph{file system}.   The file system takes the concepts of
\emph{files} and \emph{folders} used by people and application
programs, and maps them to specific operations on blocks of data
stored on the mass storage device. When a program opens a named file
and reads the first few bytes, the file system locates the file's
metadata on the drive, determines the specific block associated with
the start of the file, and reads that block into memory. Mass
storage systems can only read or write complete blocks, so the file
system may also have to buffer data between the application program
and the drive.

Figure Tk shows a conceptual view of an SD camera card; a listing of
that camera card appears in Figure Tk. Various sectors on the card are
used to store the root directory, a subdirectory ``DCIM'', and
directory entries for the 35 JPEG
images named XXXX through XXXX. Most of the sectors on the card are
used to store the JPEG images themselves. But the card also contains a
significant amount of data that not visible when the card is
inserted into a laptop: there are deleted JPEGs and deleted directory
entries. Some of the deleted JPEGs exist in their entirity and can be
easily recovered using the proper tools. Others exist as fragments and
can only be recovered with difficulty. 

In this chapter you'll learn why file systems retain information after the
user deletes it, how to find and exploit this kind of residual
information, and how to design computer systems so that such
information is not retained.

\section{Background: File System Structures}
This section describes how file systems are structured on a drive. The
examples will be based on the two most popular file systems today, the
FAT file system developed by Microsoft in the 1980s and widely used in
digital cameras, and the NTFS file system developed by Microsoft in
the 1990s and used for most versions of Windows from Windows NT
through Windows 8.


\subsection{Partitioning and Volume Management}

Although a file system can be stored directly on the drive, with the
file sector of the drive being used to store the first sector of the
file system, this is not commonly done. Instead, the first 1 or 2
sectors are used for a \emph{partition table} that describes the
locations of the file systems. In this way a single device can be used
to simulate multiple logical devices. Two commonly used partitioning
schemes are the \emph{Master Boot Record} and the \emph{GUID Partition
  Table} scheme.\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table}
       \wikipediab{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record}

The term \emph{physical volume} is used variously to describe a
physical disk, a partition on a physical disk, or a Logical Unit
Number (LUN) of a storage
system.\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Unit_Number}
Physical volumes can be used directly to hold a file system or can be
grouped together with a Logical Volume Management (LVM)
system\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management}. An
LVM can group multiple physical volumes together in to a single
physical volume that is large or more reliable than the volumes that
it built from. Volume managers can also implement
\emph{snapshots}\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_(computer_storage)}
through the use of
\emph{copy-on-write}\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write}.

\subsection{Files and File Systems}
The word \emph{file} is commonly used to describe a sequence of data
that is stored on a computer mass storage system. On modern computers
files are sequences of zero or more \emph{bytes}. Files have a length
that is set at any given point in time, but can be readily
changed. Files can have names and other associated \emph{metadata}
such as timestamps, an owner, and a group. Files have traditionally
been grouped together in
\emph{directories}\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_directory}. also
called \emph{folders}. 

The phrase \emph{File
  System}\wikipedia{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file} is
used to describe the part of the computer's operating
system that manages a storage system. However, the term is also used
to describe the very sectors on a mass storage device that contain the
files.

It is important to realize that files are an \emph{abstraction} that
was created for the purpose of managing data. There is nothing
inherent in the design of computers, operating systems or mass storage
devices that requires the use of files. A raw disk can be used as
virtual memory \emph{backing store} or as a storage system for a
database. Instead of stored as a sequence of bytes in a file, data can be stored as
objects that are persisted in memory, or as BLOBs in a database.

It is also important to realize that any computational storage device
or abstraction can be used to virtualize and contain any other storage
device. That is, a file can be stored in a file system, but a file
system can also be created and stored inside a file (this is
essentially what a disk image is). Most operating systems can swap to raw
partitions or to files, but file systems can also be created inside
RAM or virtual memory.

Adding to the complexity of the forensic examiner is
\emph{encryption}, which can be applied at the interface between any
of these abstractions. Encryption can be performed in the storage
device itself (as in the case of an encrypting hard drive), in the
disk driver, in the logical volume management system, in the file
system, or at the application level.

\subsection{File Systems of Forensic Interest}
There are a variety of different kinds of file systems in use on
modern computer systems:
\begin{description}
\item[Disk file systems] organize files and directories on
  block-oriented storage systems. These are of interest to those
  engaged in MEDEX operations. Popular file systems include FAT32
  (used primary on removable storage devices and camera cards), NTFS
  (Microsoft's New Technology File System), and HFS+ (Apple's
  Hierarchical File System used on Macs and iPhones).
\item[Distributed file systems] allow a computer to access
  information on remote servers as if it is stored
  locally. Distributed file systems are forensically interesting
  because many use local storage to cache information from the remote
  servers. Analyzing local storage can therefore give clues as to what
  was accessed remotely, and when it was accessed.
\item[Virtual file systems] use the file and directory abstraction to
  make it easy to access other information. For example, the Linux
  \url{/dev} file system is used to access devices through the file
  system, the \url{/sys} file system is used to access features within
  the system kernel, and the \url{/net} file system accesses the
  automounter. Virtual file systems are not typically of interest in
  MEDEX because they do not leave residual information on a storage
  device. However, virtual file systems are relevant in malware
  analysis and intrusion response.
\end{description}

As this chapter is written, specific file systems of interest include:
\begin{description}
\item[FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32] file systems developed by Microsoft for use with
  DOS. FAT refers to the File Allocation Table, an array of integers
  that is used to determine if a cluster is in use or free. (In FAT, a
  \emph{cluster} is a block of 1, 2, 4, 8 or more disk sectors.) The number
  refers to the size of the integers in the array (12 bits, 16 bits or
  32 bits). Today implementations of FAT are built in to practically every
  operating system, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, most digital
  cameras, and practically every other device with a USB or SD
  interface. 
\item[NTFS] 
\item[HFS+]
\item[YAFFS2]
\item[EXT2/3]
\item[EXT4]
\end{description}

Information can be hidden in a file system by storing data in blocks
that are allocated but not used to hold content\cite{dfrws2005:KnutEcksteinAndMarkoJahnke}. 

\section{Exercise: Windows - Creating and Testing FAT32 Disks}

This exercise is designed to help you understand how file systems
store information and the opportunities for retaining
privacy-sensitive information that is not visible to the user. 

This exercise will be done with a \emph{virtual disk}. Like a physical
mass storage device, a virtual disk consists of a set of numbered data
blocks. But instead of storing those blocks directly in on a mass
storage device, the blocks are stored in another file. The operating
system treats the virtual disk like a physical drive: it can be
formatted, files can be copied to it, and so on. But we can also
access the underlying file that holds the virtual disk. This makes it
easier to inspect the individual data blocks.

We will use the Windows |DISKPART| command to create and manage virtual
disks. |DISKPART| is a command-line tool that needs to run as
Administrator.

We will be using these commands:
\begin{tabular}{ll}
help partition & shows partition command available\\
create vdisk & Creates a virtual disk \\
list disk & Shows available disks \\
list vdisk & Shows detailed information about the available VDisks\\
list partition & Shows available partitions \\
\end{tabular}

We will create a text file on the virtual disk that has a sensitive file
name and file contents. We will then take a screen shot and save it on
the computer's hard drive as a JPEG. We will then delete the text file
and empty the trash. Finally we will inspect the disk image and see if
we can find the text file and the screen shot.



\begin{steps}
\step Click the Start button, type |diskpart| into the search field,
and click on the |diskpart| program icon.
\step The User Account Control will ask you to verify that you want to
run the DiskPart, a program that can make ``changes to the computer.''
Click ``Yes.''  The |diskpart.exe| window should appear.
\step If you haven't done so already, right-click on the window's
titlebar and select ``Properties.'' Click on the Layout tab and change
the ``Screen Buffer Size'' to 9999. This will allow you to scroll
backwards and see the entire history of your DISKPART session.
\step Type |help| to see the list of commands that the DISKPART
command supports. You may need to make the window larger.

\step Create a 16MB virtual disk with the command:

\begin{Verbatim}
DISKPART> create vdisk file="C:\disk1.vhd" maximum=16
\end{Verbatim}

\step Attach the disk you just created:
\begin{Verbatim}
DISKPART> attach vdisk
\end{Verbatim}

\step Verify that the disk is attached:
\begin{Verbatim}
DISKPART> list disk
...
DISKPART> list vdisk
\end{Verbatim}

\step Now we need to create a partition, assign a letter to that
partition, and format the drive. We will call this drive K: and format
it with FAT. 
\begin{Verbatim}
DISKPART> create partition primary
DISKPART> assign letter=k
DISKPART> format fs=fat label="WORK"
\end{Verbatim}

At this point we have a 16MB virtual disk attached to the computer as
drive K:. The drive's contents are stored in the file |C:\disk1.vhd|.

Lastly, we want to put a file on this disk. For test purposes we are
going to use a small file with a distinctive file name and file
contents.

\step Run the windows NotePad program by clicking the Start program,
typing ``Notepad'' into the search field, and clicking on the icon.

\step Type this text into the document:  ``The phone number is
202-555-1212.'' You can use your own phone number and add additional
information if you wish.

\step Select ``File/Save As'' and save the file on the WORK (K:) drive
with the name ``file-name-example-0001.txt''. 

\step Close the Notepad program.

\step Now we will detach the virtual disk:

\begin{Verbatim}
DISKPART> detach vdisk
\end{Verbatim}

\section{File Deletion and Deleted File Recovery}\label{deleted_file_recovery}
Different file system implementations delete files in different ways.

Traditionally, file systems simply \emph{unlinked} files---the pointer
to the file was removed from the directory, and the blocks associated
with the file were returned to the free list.


\section{Exploiting File System Metadata}
File system metadata can be used to determine usage.
