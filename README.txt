This project seeks to develop course materials and a public
domain/Creative Commons textbook to teach the increasingly important
and largely untaught skill of Technical Privacy Auditing.  This
project makes significant use of the computer forensic materials
developed under NSF DUE-0919593, "Creating Realistic Forensic Corpora
for Undergraduate Education and Research" and should be considered a
follow-on project.

Specifically, this project seeks to develop materials that teach how
to perform in-depth privacy audits of residual information left on
computer systems and cell phones, as well as to audit the information
transmitted over the Internet in a client/server environment. This is
best done using computer forensic tools, as these tools are
specifically designed to find such information.

This proposal seeks to use existing forensic corpora where possible,
and to create new corpora where necessary, that demonstrate privacy
failures in typical software and client-server web-based applications.
Extending beyond the typical computer science curriculum, these
materials will be usable for demonstrations in a wide variety of
curricula---for example, in a course on technology and public
policy---broadening the exposure that students in these fields receive
to these important STEM topics.
